<br><h3>3rd Year Software Development Project 
<br>Semester 1 yr 3(Data Representation and Querying) GMIT</h3>

<h3>Post IT Flask-Python App</h3>

<h3><b>Data Representation and Querying GMIT Year3</b></h3>
<br>
This repository contains code and information for a third-year undergraduate project for the module Data Representation and Querying 
That I am currently undertaking
<br>
<h4><b>Project Overview</b></h4><i><p> 
I have decided to create a Single-Page Web Application (SPA) that is a simulation of a Post It sticky List.<br>
The project was guided by the following excerpt from the project instructions:<br>
You are required to develop a single-page web application(SPA) written in the programming language Python using the Flask framework.<br>
You must devise an idea for a web application,<br>
write the software,<br>
write documentation explaining how the application works, and write a short user guide for it.<i></p>
<p><i>The application is written using the Flask library in Python 3 as well as rethinkdb 
<br>
ALL must be installed to run the project there is no need to create the database  as the Database will be generated once the application is run.</i>
<br>   
<i></p>
<b>Architecture</b><br>
This web application runs in Python 3 using the Flask web micro-framework and uses Rethinkdb as a database.<br> 

Python 3 and Flask were requirements for the project But Rethinkdb was my choice as its a very useful and user friendly database server
to work with once it is setup<br>
<br>
<p><i>	  
The App that I chose to create using (python flask and rethinkdb) is a simple POST IT Sticky App.
The reason I chose this  type App was it was relatively not to complex to implement and was something I had been thinking of doing on a different programming language in my spare time.
My Choice of DB was rethinkdb as it is very simplistic to implemnt and scale as well as that it has a very good API libary and documentation on its website it is also an opensource database for realtime web apps and is useable on very near every OS available
